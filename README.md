## Getting Started

1. Clone this to your computer. Preferably in your `~/Code` directory or some other directory that is not a mess and/or connected to One Drive or some other cloud service.
1. `cd` into the directory.
1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
   l. Run `code .` to open the project in Visual Studio Code.

## Adding the Data

1. Create a new file, `data.js` in the root of the project. You can do this by running `touch src/data.js` in the terminal, or just use the Explorer in Visual Studio Code. **Be sure** to place it in the right directory - `src`.
1. Paste the following code into `data.js`:

```js
/**
 * 1. TODO: Filter out the `Vacant Title` from the `CHAMPIONS` array. Also, remove the corresponding index from the `BELTS` array.
 * 2. TODO: Filter out the `Tag Team Champions` from the `BELTS` array. Also, remove the corresponding indices from the `CHAMPIONS` array.
 * 3. TODO: Alphabetize `CHAMPIONS` by last name.
 * 4. TODO: Create a new ARRAY of objects called `CHAMPIONSHIPS` that contains the following properties:
 *   - `title` - The name of the title.
 *  - `champion` - The name of the champion.
